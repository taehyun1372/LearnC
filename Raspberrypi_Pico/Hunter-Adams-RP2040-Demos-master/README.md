As of 6/30/2025, this repository has been refactored such that **every demo is a standalone project.** As such, you can download/clone this directory and import any project using the Raspberry Pi Pico VSCode extension and it will work. For detailed instructions, please [see here](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/CourseMaterials/Building_Demos.html).
